==========================================

TO: CREW MEMBER [UNREGISTERED]  
FROM: STATION SYSTEMS // ARRIVAL AUTHORITY  
SUBJECT: DOCKING COMPLETE — INITIAL CLEARANCE  

Congratulations on surviving the approach.  
Your vessel has been moored under Dockmaster LOSHE’s supervision.  
Atmospheric seal confirmed. Cargo manifest under review.  

PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE CLEAN ROOM.  
Failure to comply will result in **Q-Team intervention**.

Upon arrival you will undergo:
- Decontamination procedure (mandatory)  
- O₂ credit assignment  
- O₂ taxation enrollment (10cr/day/person)  
- Registration of biometric and cortical data  

Your issued **O₂ Credstick** functions as identification, wallet, and locator.  
Misplacing it constitutes a Class-C Offense. Replacements are 10kcr + tissue sample.  

STATION REGULATIONS (MANDATORY):
• Carry your O₂ Credstick at all times.  
• Do not enter restricted zones — especially The Choke.  
• Store all hull-breachable weapons in registered lockers.  
• Avoid contact with unlicensed cybermod users.  
• Report auditory hallucinations immediately.  

You are reminded that Prospero’s Dream is not a home.  
It is a system. Systems must be fed.  

Report to your assigned berth. Sleep if you can.  
The Dream never does.
