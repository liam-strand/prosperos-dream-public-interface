==========================================

SOURCE: PROSPERO NEWS NETWORK (A SERVICE OF TEMPEST CO.)  
SUBJECT: OPERATIONAL UPDATES AND RUMOR CONTROL  

Good evening, Dreamers.  
As always, Prospero’s Dream thanks you for your continued loyalty, productivity, and calm.  

Rumors circulating across the Dry Dock and CanyonHeavy.market concerning a potential **Teamster work stoppage** are **unfounded**.  
All vessels remain cleared for docking, refueling, and departure.  
Cargo flow remains within acceptable variance thresholds.  

Teamsters Local 32819L leadership has assured us that any talk of a “strike” is *unofficial chatter* spread by malicious external actors.  
Station Management encourages all residents to verify information only through approved PNN bulletins.  

CURRENT NOTICES:
- Minor scheduling delays in hangar maintenance.  
- Temporary rationing of Sycorax shipments (logistical review).  
- Increased Tempest Co. security presence in the Outer Ring (routine exercise).  
- “Safety Inspections” may delay airlock clearance by up to six hours.  

STATEMENT FROM YANDEE, VOR OF THE GOLYANOVO II BRATVA:
> “The Dream thrives on cooperation. Labor and loyalty are twin virtues.  
>  Those who whisper dissent are merely asleep. They will awaken soon.”  

Unverified reports of Teamster ships clustering beyond the piers are to be **ignored**.  
These vessels are undergoing legitimate recalibration and are not in defiance of station regulations.  

All residents are reminded:
- Tampering with comm arrays is an executable offense.  
- Unauthorized unions, assemblies, and chants of solidarity disrupt oxygen flow.  
- Please refrain from staring directly at the security drones; they find it unsettling.  

Prospero’s Dream remains the safest and most profitable port in the Outer Rim.  
You have nothing to fear.  
Please continue your assigned duties, breathe evenly, and remember:  

**LOYALTY IS OXYGEN.**
